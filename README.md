Maybe I need to initialize something to start some other functions, anyway.

多线程实现Server和Client的收发同步：
A symbol means 标志位-num to label different functions, i.e., functions in the requirement list.
Server主循环接收Client的Socket连接， the server will use multiple threads to connect each Client.
Client启动的客户端，依据题目需要来运行程序；
client通过多线程创建新的客户端

/to means talk privately

Symbol means 标志位-num,来标识不同功能，即题目中“/"要求的功能
Server主循环接收Client的Socket连接，server will use multi threads to connect each Client.

<div style="display:none">
The server and clients can run on different computers in the same network, e.g. Local Area Network (LAN).
There can be multiple clients connect to a server and they can chat to each other, just like in a chat room where everyone can see other users’ messages. There’s no private chat between two users, for simplicity.
